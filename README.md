# TAIM-GAN

Text-Assisted Image Manipulation

## Description

In this project we explore the idea of changing the images according to the textual captions through generative networks

## How to use

There's two primary ways in which you can use our project: use our publicly deployed version of TAIM-GAN or deploy it locally on your machine. Also, feel free to fork and modify the source code for latter reseach

### Hugging Face

Visit our [project's card](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ML701G7/taim-gan) on Hugging Face! It has some interesting examples:

### Docker

To set up the project locally through docker, just do the following:
1. Clone our repository using `git clone https://github.com/Dmmc123/taim-gan.git`
2. Deploy the Gradio web application using `docker-compose up`

## Datasets

We used three datasets for training, evaluation, and deployment of TAIM-GAN:
1. [COCO](https://cocodataset.org/#download)
2. [CUB](https://www.vision.caltech.edu/datasets/cub_200_2011/)
3. [UTKFace](https://susanqq.github.io/UTKFace/) with generated captions from [BLIP](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Salesforce/BLIP)

## Train/evaluate

Example of training script:

```
train.py --data-dir data --split train --num-capt 5 --batch-size 16 --num-workers 8
```

Example of evaluation script:

```
compute_metrics.py --data-dir data --split test --num-capt 10 --batch-size 32 --num-workers 4
```

## Project Organization

Project uses template from [cookiecutter](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science) for data science projects

## References

The project is primarily based on [LWGAN](https://github.com/mrlibw/Lightweight-Manipulation/) research with the following differences:

* We have removed the redundant modules from the source code
* We have refactored from scratch the existing code by providing type hints for the most part of code-base
* We have covered most parts of code with unit and intergrations tests
* We removed the deprecated functionality and upgraded the project according the latest version of PyTorch 1.12.1
* We have collected new dataset with captions for facial pictures and finetuned TAIM-GAN with it

Also here are some other researches we used as an additional reference:
